:hp-tags: Development, Lightning, Aura

Almost two and a half years has passed since Salesforce announced their new and sexy Lightning Experience (a.k.a. LEX) - I found this amazing, but lots of organizations are still using Salesforce Classic UI! It's true, that some features are still unavailable for Lightning Experience, and some of the classics users still should postpone their migration to modern LEX, but it seems, that not only unreleased features is a problem with migration, but also some massive coding concepts have changed since then. This article will cover both - what's still not released in LEX, and what changed developer needs to apply to existing customization so this migration won't be unsuccessful for business.

== Chapter I: Pre-Development Considerations

Prior to development, you need to check, if it's possible to migrate to LEX - by Salesforce features which are already in the organization. Salesforce development team are doing their best to deliver most of the functionality to LEX, so, it only means that you can plan your migration pretty soon.
Below are the list of the features, which are *not* available in LEX:

* General Platform
** *Javascript buttons*
** Mass Actions On A Records List View
** Mass Inline Editing for List View
** *Recylcle Bin*
** Printable View
** *Manual Sharing*
* Sales Cloud
** *Account Contact Roles*
** Account Partners

** Mass Email (for Users, Cases, Campaigns). Mass Email Scheduling
** Customizable Forecasting
** Similiar Opportunities
** *Territory Management*
** Opportunity Partners
* Service Cloud
** Public Knowledge
** Solutions
** Ideas
** https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.noversion.service_sdk_android.meta/service_sdk_android/android_sos_overview.htm[SOS]
** Knowledge (can be used, bot lots of functionallity is unavaliable at this moment)

If your business is OK to switch to Salesforce Classic to continue to use those features - then you'll be fine to proceed with customization changes

== Chapter II: Moving Existing Customization To LEX

Basically, two main issues when you're migration will be:

* Custom Javascript Buttons (some people still have all the business logic developed as a series of custom buttons!)
* Visualforce Pages

=== Custom Javascript Buttons

The main point here will be - change the javascript buttons to lightning quick actions, https://trailhead.salesforce.com/modules/lex_javascript_button_migration[here] it's descirbed in details on how to do this. The reason do ban javascript buttons is simple - it's unsafe, and usually not very user friendly. Below I'll put a simple example on how to change button from Javascript to a Lightning Quick Action.

==== 1. Identify The Process Behind Your Button

There are alot of the use cases for Javascript buttons - from simple record update - to difficult business process of creation of the data model along with triggering the webservice from Apex. Basically, the more complex your javascript button logic is - the worse is system design - and this requires rework of the whole process. But for a simple record update/new records creation, there's a very simple process of transition, which in a result will give *No Changes* for an end user flow.

==== 2. Move the code and publish changes to the layout

The simple example of the case javascript button named "Transform Social Case" 

.transform-social-case.js
[source,javascript]
----
{!REQUIRESCRIPT("/soap/ajax/23.0/connection.js")}; 

var сaseObject = new sforce.SObject("Case"); 
сaseObject.Id = "{!Case.Id}"; 
var type = "{!Case.Type}";

if ( type != "Social" ) 
{ 
    alert("error message for social case"); 
} 

else 
{ 
	сaseObject.Type = "Social Plus"; 
	сaseObject.OwnerId = "{!$User.Id}"; 
	var result = sforce.connection.update([caseObj]); 

	if (result[0].success==&apos;false&apos;) 
	{ 
		alert(result[0].errors.message); 
	} 

	else 
	{ 
		location.reload(true); 
	} 
}
----


=== Visualforce Pages

Every scenario here is pretty unique, however, few common page types can be separated: Reports pages, PDF-rendered pages and new/edit/view papes. For the PDF we'll keep it as it is - as no changes and no ability to render lightning components as a pdf. But for the report-like and new/edit/view pages we have to change it to the lightning UI;

==== 1. Set the lightning styles

==== 2. Transform the Visualforce page into set of Lightning Components


== Final Thoughts

Lightning Components - is a different view to the frontend - it's made to be reusable. Use the same button set for different pages, use lightning components as an building blocks. Visualforce Components were similiar - but developers worldwide didn't utilize the power of components and they are *not* designed as LC. So, this frontend change is the greatest change for development and a big challange for developers - will developers change thier mind about reusability?
